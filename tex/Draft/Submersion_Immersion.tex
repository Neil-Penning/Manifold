\section{Submersion and Immersion}
Again, this comes from \cite{lee_2013}.


Consider 
\[ 
    M^m \to N^n
    T_pM \to T_{f(p)}N
\]

Now, we wish to examine the number of linearly independent columns, or, the rank of \( df \).

Let us examine two cases: 


\begin{boxExample}{2-Sphere in 3-space}
    Let \( f : S^2 \to \RR^3 \)
    We note that \( df_p \) is matrix with three rows, and two columns, so it can have at most two linearly independent columns.
    Let us assume that \( df_p \) has full rank everywhere
\end{boxExample}

\begin{boxExample}{3-space projected to 2-space}
\end{boxExample}
