Mathematicians


Hausdorff Space
Locally Euclidean
Abelian Group
Cauchy Sequence
Alexandroff's Line

Unfortunately, transitioning away from Proper Adjectives commits two sins

And much worse, if a reader's first exposure to an object were in this book, then they would be unable to communicate with other mathematicians.
This problem is intractable, so in the book, I have employed the (somewhat clunky) compromise


Hausdorff's Unique Limit Space
Locally Euclidean
Abel's Commutative Group
Cauchy's Shrinking Sequence
Alexandrov's Long Line
